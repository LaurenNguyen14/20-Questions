# 20-Questions

A 20 questions game that guesses what movie the user is thinking about. This project includes: 
 - The design of the game with MVC design pattern
 - Source codes in file "src" (I also implemented my own data structures needed in folder datastructure) 
 - XML tree representation of the game
